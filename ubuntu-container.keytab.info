**This is not an actual keytab file, but info on the file.**

For AD KDCs, you can create keytabs via `realm join` or `net ads` commands or by manual creation of keytabs using `ktpass` in Windows or `msktutil` in Linux.

This blog goes into more detail:

Some considerations:
- `realm join` and 'net ads` are interactive commands, which aren't ideal for containers
- `ktpass` would be run on a Windows KDC, but it can be challenging getting the keytabs to the correct locations
- `msktutil` needs to `kinit` as a principal that has access to create keytabs (such as administrator) and can be used to create/update keytabs. This can be easily scripted from a Linux client.

The end result keytab can be viewed with ktutil or klist commands (available with krb5 tools, depending on the OS used).

A keytab needs to be current when building the container to ensure proper Kerberos authentication. If it is not current, you can update it and replace it.

Example:

# klist -kte /scripts/dockerfiles/ubuntu-container/ubuntu-container.keytab
Keytab name: FILE:/scripts/dockerfiles/ubuntu-container/ubuntu-container.keytab
KVNO Timestamp           Principal
